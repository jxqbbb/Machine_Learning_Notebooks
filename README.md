    The goal of the notebook was to implement the entire data science workflow:
    <ul>
      <li>Loading the dataset (CSV from Kaggle.com)</li>
      <li>Getting to know the data (Understanding the problem, summarizing statistics, exploring using pandas)</li>
      <li>Data cleaning (Filling missing values using different methods, including EDA and machine learning for missing value predictions)</li>
      <li>Exploratory data analysis (Data visualization, statistical testing, correlation analysis)</li>
      <li>Feature selection and engineering (Dropping features, encoding)</li>
      <li>Predictive model selection (Logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, regularization)</li>
      <li>Evaluation (Submitting predictions to Kaggle.com competition)</li>
    </ul>

In this notebook, my goal was to maximize the performance of the kNN predictive algorithm. I achieved this by conducting a comprehensive analysis, using different evaluation metrics, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. Additionally, I implemented PCA analysis, pipelines, and various kinds of cross-validation methods to familiarize myself with scikit-learn's implementation of these functionalities.
